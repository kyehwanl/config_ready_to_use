Following are the configs and basic application for the development environment


Contents
========
Vim
tmux
screen
vifm
etc


Steps
=====
0. Install utils and libraries
    yum -y install epel-release tmux vim ctags cscope gcc automake autoconf libtool net-tools psmisc patch wget

1. git cloning into any place

2. copy all the contents including hidden files into the account root directory
    - it may need to disable the default aliasing (alias cp='cp -i'),
      which will stop to ask a confirmation when overwriting.
    - for example, 
        yes | cp -rf xxx yyy
        or 
        unalias cp

3. extract _.vimXXX.tar.gz into the root directory

4. set the evn variable, TERM, to have colors
    (for example)
    - export TERM=screen-256color

5. source .bashrc and .bash_xxx to apply changes
    



Troubleshoot
=============

1. in Vifm, hitting 's' goes to open bash shell, but sometimes it opens 'sh'.
    Theh, go to .vifm/vifmrc, change the  shell command like following lines

    " Start shell in current directory 
    "nnoremap s :shell<cr>             
    nnoremap s :!bash<cr>
