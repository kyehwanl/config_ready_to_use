Following are the configs and basic application for the development environment


Contents
========
Vim
tmux
screen
vifm
etc


Steps
=====
0. Install utils and libraries
    yum -y install epel-release tmux vim ctags cscope gcc automake autoconf libtool net-tools psmisc patch wget

1. git cloning into any place

2. copy all the contents including hidden files into the account root directory
    - it may need to disable the default aliasing (alias cp='cp -i'),
      which will stop to ask a confirmation when overwriting.
    - for example, 
        yes | cp -rf xxx yyy
        or 
        unalias cp

3. extract _.vimXXX.tar.gz into the root directory

4. set the evn variable, TERM, to have colors
    (for example)
    - export TERM=screen-256color

5. source .bashrc and .bash_xxx to apply changes
    



Troubleshoot
=============

1. in Vifm, hitting 's' goes to open bash shell, but sometimes it opens 'sh'.
    Theh, go to .vifm/vifmrc, change the  shell command like following lines

    " Start shell in current directory 
    "nnoremap s :shell<cr>             
    nnoremap s :!bash<cr>
    
    
    
    
        
VIM quick setup with color scheme - soloarized 
===============================================
(https://vimawesome.com/plugin/solarized-8)

1.  Vim supports packages (echo has('packages') prints 1)

        In vim command line, 
                :echo has('packages')  --> prints 1


2. download into 'pack'

        git clone https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8.git \
    ~/.vim/pack/themes/opt/solarized8


3. vimrc

        set background=dark  (or light)
        colorscheme solarized8


4. customizing vimrc 

        " Use Vim settings, rather then Vi settings (much better!).
        " This must be first, because it changes other options as a side effect.
        set nocompatible

        " allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
        set backspace=indent,eol,start

        set background=dark
        colorscheme solarized8
        syntax on
        set hlsearch
        set autoindent


        set nobackup
        set nowritebackup
        set history=50      " keep 50 lines of command line history
        set ruler           " show the cursor position all the time
        set showcmd         " display incomplete commands
    set incsearch       " do incremental searching"


        set shiftwidth=4
        set tabstop=8
        set softtabstop=4
        "set textwidth=79
        set smartindent
        set cindent


        " -------- move among windows ---------------
        nmap <C-H> <C-W>h
        nmap <C-J> <C-W>j
        nmap <C-K> <C-W>k
        nmap <C-L> <C-W>l

    " -------- Search for Visually Selected Text" ------
    vnorem // y/<c-r>"<cr>"

    set splitright   " Puts new vsplit windows to the right of the current"
    set splitbelow   " Puts new split windows to the bottom of the current"

    " Easier horizontal scrolling
    map zl zL
    map zh zH



5. TERM better to use screen-256color ranther than xterm-256color

    - copy the following line into .bashrc or .bash_profile
    export TERM=screen-256color
